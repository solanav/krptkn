Metadata is usually defined as "data that gives us information about other data." For example: the date a file was edited, the author of a document, or the program used to edit a photograph.

Most of the software that runs on our computers stores a lot of information about our files. Much of this information is harmless (modification date, dimensions of a photograph, license of a file, etc.) but we must be careful not to reveal compromising information (geolocation, names, private comments, etc).

The vast majority of social media and file upload services remove metadata automatically, but many smaller companies do not. And even if they tried to correct it, there is currently no standard tool or library that facilitates this task.

The purpose of this thesis is the development of a framework that serves to extract this metadata from a web page, filter those that are potentially dangerous, and generate reports with all the relevant information.
