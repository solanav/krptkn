Metadata are a crucial part of our day to day. Despite this, we have no direct contact with them. Only other programs take advantage of the metadata of files to facilitate their use and offer us interesting information. Because of this, many of the files uploaded to the internet contain metadata that may be leaking sensitive information. Even though most of the commonly used social media networks do remove the metadata from your files automatically, many smaller or non-tech companies do not. And even if these smaller companies had an interest in checking the metadata they upload, there is no standard tool they can rely on.

In this project, a framework is going to be developed to help extract, filter and visualize this metadata without requiring technical knowledge. This framework is going to be developed in Elixir with some modules written in C to take advantage of existing libraries.
