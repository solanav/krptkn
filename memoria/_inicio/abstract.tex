ESTO ES UN PLACEHOLDER HASTA QUE LA VERSIÓN EN ESPAÑOL ESTÉ TERMINADA

Metadata is ''data that gives us information about other data.´´ For example: the date a file was edited, the author of a document, or the program used to edit a photo. Most of the software that runs on our computers stores this information about our files without user interaction. This does not have to be a problem since most of them are harmless (date of saving, dimensions of a photo, license of a file, etc.) but we must be careful to eliminate the one that is not (geolocation, names, private comments, etc).

Although the vast majority of social media and file upload services already take care of removing metadata automatically, many smaller companies don't. And even if they tried, there is currently no standard tool or library that facilitates this task.

The purpose of this work is the development of a framework that serves to extract this metadata from a web page, filter those that are potentially dangerous and generate reports with all the relevant information.
