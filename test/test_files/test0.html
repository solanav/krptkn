For the US presidential election:<br/>
If your state is a swing state, <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/08/25/only-real-leftist-argument-voting-joe-biden-november">vote for Biden</a>.  Otherwise, vote Green &mdash; <a href="https://howiehawkins.us/address-to-the-delegates-at-the-green-party-convention/">vote for Howie Hawkins</a> and Angela Walker for president/VP.  I delayed my decision hoping that Biden would support the progressive programs that the US and the world desperately need, but by choosing Harris he reaffirmed his rejection of them.  If we keep voting for the plutocratist lesser evil, each time the plutocrats give us something worse than the previous lesser evil.

	   4] in anticipation of President Donald Trump illegitimately declaring
	   victory in the Nov. 3 election.*
	   That's a good idea, but they have messed up the web site where they
	   publish the details: it depends on nonfree Javascript code, and it is
	   totally inaccessible in the Free World.  I can't see even one word of
	   the contents of their site, only a message saying "Enable Javascript."
	   No way!
	 <p>
	   It is a shame that I can't (without sacrificing my freedom and
	   principles) find an event near me, and neither can you, nor can I in
	   good conscience post an urgent note asking everyone to look at the
	   site and find an event to join.
	 <p>
	   This time, we have considerable notice &mdash; 18 days to go before Nov 4.
	   Maybe this is enough time to correct the deficiency, rather than
	   merely bemoan it.
	 <p>
	   If you are a skilled web developer, and you have a web site where you
	   can make a page without Javascript, and run an hourly cron job on the
	   net, please try it.  See if you can scrape the data from their site
	   and make a simple HTML file listing all the events, sorted in some
	   natural way.  Put that that page on your site, with a bried
	   introduction saying what these events are for.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The US needs a constitutional amendment to limit the president's power
      to pardon convicts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/10/roger-stone-trump-commutes-prison-sentence">whose crimes were related to the president</a>.  The
      authors of the constitution may have supposed no president would sink
      so low as to do that.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Automation in work is aimed at atomizing work, <a href="https://points.datasociety.net/the-robots-are-just-automated-management-tools-b9bf28c4434">making workers fungible,
	and running them to exhaustion</a>.</p>

    <p>
      I think these practices ought to be prohibited, even if it requires
      imposing stiff, harsh penalties on employment systems.  It is wrong to
      apply such laws to people, but an employment system is not a person,
      even if it is part of a business that belongs to a person.</p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I think there ought to be a law that when a company tells workers that their jobs will be outsourced, and that before they are let go they must train their own replacements, the workers don't have to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The law would say that they can treat the order to train their replacements as being laid off, so that they can stop working, and start collecting unimployemnt insurance, on the day that the training process is supposed to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The law could award them a paid vacation too, why not? That detail won't be crucial &mdash; the effect of this law is that companies won't do that sort of thing at all.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Let's put a substantial tax on all shipments of products from stores to retail customers.  That would benefit all local stores, for which shipping is not needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, put a substantial tax on all retail sales in which the store can identify the purchaser.  That would encourage non-surveillance retail.
      </p>

<h3>No national identity cards</h3>
<p>
I'd like to make a list of countries that do not require a national
identity card, and have no plans to adopt one. If you live in or have
confirmed knowledge of such a country, please send email to rms at
gnu.org.

<p>
Here's my list of countries with no national ID cards
and no plans for one: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK.
Australia's previous government tried to
institute national ID cards, but the Labor government dropped
the plan.</p>

<p>India has mostly finished imposing a national biometric ID number
in a grand act of oppression.
</p>

<p>Switzerland has national ID cards which are optional,
but they or some other government ID card are needed for some purposes.
<p>
Iceland doesn't have ID cards as such, but they
have ID numbers that citizens are forced to use frequently.
For example, the national ID number is often required to
rent a video or use a gym.
</p>

<p>
Denmark issues non-photo ID cards with a "person number", and many
services use this card to identify people.
</p>

<p>
Norway will impose a national
<a href="http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Norwegian_citizens_now_required_by_law_to_give_their_fingerprint_to_the_police.html">biometric
ID card</a>.
</p>

<h3>The Lifelong Activist</h3>
<p>
People often ask how I manage to continue devoting myself to
progressive activism (such as the free software movement) for
years without burning out.  The best way I can answer is by
recommending a book, <a href="http://lifelongactivist.com">
The Lifelong Activist</a> by Hillary Rettig.

<p>I disagree with the book on one theoretical point in the last
part of the book: we shouldn't think of political activism as
<em>being</em> marketing and sales, because those terms refer to
business, and politics is something much more
important than mere business.  However, this doesn't diminish
the value of the book's practical advice about borrowing
techniques from marketing and sales.</p>
